# project_earth

I forgot "Project Earth" was a series on _The Discovery Channel_ a while back. (No matter. Nowadays, that network is more concerned with being "Naked" while also "Afraid".)

This is my Final Project for the New York Code and Design Academy (NYCDA). There, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, that Google is my friend, and that Stack Overflow is a smug know-it-all who just *cannot be bothered to explain*.

This Project showcases Object-Oriented JavaScript's role in the Keyhole Markup Language (KML), which resembles XML (but will get offended if you point that out).
