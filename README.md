# Project Earth

I forgot "Project Earth" was a series on _The Discovery Channel_ a while back. (No matter. Nowadays, that network is more concerned with being "Naked" while also "Afraid".)

This is my Final Project for the *N*ew *Y*ork *C*ode and *D*esign *A*cademy (NYCDA). There, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, that Google is my friend, and that Stack Overflow is a smug know-it-all who just *cannot be bothered to explain*.

This Project showcases Object-Oriented JavaScript's role in the Keyhole Markup Language (KML), which resembles XML (but will get offended if you point that out).
