# Project Earth

I forgot "Project Earth" was a series on _The Discovery Channel_ a while back. (No matter. Nowadays, that network is more concerned with being "Naked" while also "Afraid".)

It will, someday (hopefully soon), be the home of a KMZ file that will allow the User to go on a magical history tour of the greater Easton, Pennsylvania area. It will be as fun as it seems, if you're a local history buff like myself. It will be even *more* fun than it seems, if you don't think you care about this sort of thing. Give it a chance!
