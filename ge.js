//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~GE SEMI-FINAL~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~//


//Using the Google Earth API and its proprietrary KML markup language,
//together with the HTML/CSS and JavaScript I've learned here, make
//an API within GE that guides a User around an area with unique
//pictures and interactivity. You know, to make learning FUN!



//Basically:
Map.addLayer(SOMETHING);

//That "SOMETHING", I have several ideas. Most prominent uses my
//otherwise useless History Degree to focus of historical sites
//in an aroud the City. Unlike what is already on GE, the placemarkers
//would be edited with HTML/CSS (maybe JS, too...?) to make it unique
//and then JS overlays could mark, say, historic areas, sites where
//former, destroyed buildings once stood, events, etc.



//Example of integrated JS:

Map.addLayer(ee.Image('/easton/demographic_concentrations_2016'));
